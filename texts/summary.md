**General question** How do small carnivores use and share space in a human dominated landscape?

# To do

1. Availability distribution of landscape (VI) and utilisation distribution
2. Movement bout characteristics (speed, distance, duration) in relation to landscape (VI), landuse type, distance from human settlement, occupancy of other species (only species X, regions of overlap), hour of day, season
3. Find 95% kde for each individual
4. Create a 1km buffer around human settlements
5. Assign a human use index to each tehsil: total population*distance from nearest settlement
6. Find regions of overlap
